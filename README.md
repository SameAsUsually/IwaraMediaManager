# IwaraMediaManagerWpf

A Iwara.TV Client for Windows. 
You can download, manage and watch your favorite MMDs in a single place. 
Every video downloaded with Iwara Media Manager has stored a url to the corresponding video and artist page on Iwara for easier access.

# Usage

On first time running the app, you get asked to select your video folder. If you don't already have one, create it. 
After the first video lookup, do not manually insert videos into the folders. A video file import may come in future versions.
If you already have videos on your PC, make sure the folder has the following structure:

- Iwara Videos Root (Name does not matter)
    - ArtistName
        - Video
